# My Portfolio Website
------------------------
When deciding on my website I wanted to it to be minimal, professional and have the ability to capture my personality. Those three attributes can sometimes be at odds so it was a challenge. I realized early on that this was wouldn't happen in equal portions and I would have to rank the importance of the factors. I think showing my personality is the most important concept to portay as it will be the determining factor in where I will work. I think the next quality to showcase is my professionalism and the experience I possess. Finally I will try to keep the design as minimal as possible to show case the other two attributes.

# Inspiration
----------------------------------
My inspiration is derived from things that I like. I felt it was best to use other websites first as inspiration and then found myself looking at art and pictures for a lot more of my vision. For the actual websites please go to my folder called portfolio examples. I wanted a single static homepage with links to three more pages. I chose my colors based on my personal style and they were black, white and red. 

# Design
------------------------------------------
[Scanned Document.pdf](https://github.com/david-forer/portfolio/files/1291002/Scanned.Document.pdf) My design has stayed the same from the beginning except for my background. I found that the background image wasn't loading properly so I made some subtle changes to it. I wanted the navigation in the upper left and the logo in the upper right for usability. I have 2 main content sections for the basis of my story on each page. The final element is the footer which originally was 2 boxe but later revised to 1 and centered.

# Changes
------------------------------------------
The only real change was deleted one of my flexbox's in the bottom footer section. I also had to revise some of my coloring based on staying with the black and the white with red as the standout color. Originally I had some very small colors added to my form and the social icons.

# Challenges
--------------------------------------------
The background image was the main challenge to my site. Getting it so it was clean and clear but also spanned the whole page properly. I also had some issues with the contact form working properly and tried to upload a javascript file that essentially wrecked my site. I needed to understand how to use flexbox properly for a responsive site. Finally I didn't properly back up my site and twice deleted my files and had to rebuild my site.
