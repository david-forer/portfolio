# My Portfolio Website

When deciding on my website I wanted to it to be minimal, professional and have the ability to capture my personality. Those three attributes can sometimes be at odds so it was a challenge. I realized early on that this was wouldn't happen in equal portions and I would have to rank the importance of the factors. I think showing my personality is the most important concept to portay as it will be the determining factor in where I will work. I think the next quality to showcase is my professionalism and the experience I possess. Finally I will try to keep the design as minimal as possible to show case the other two attributes.
