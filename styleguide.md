Style Guide

1. Logo  Looking for black and white logo that represents my name. Preferable to have my initials as the basis of the logo due to size and ability to make it sleek looking. Modern design with long thin flowing letters and sharp narrow edges. Location is at the top or top right right depending on final version of site.

2. Color  My color patette is going to be simpl and straightforward yet contrasting. My color will be black and white as the two most constrasting colors in the spectrum. The third and final color will be one that stands out with either of those two for emphasis. The color chosen is red for this distinction of contrast to both white and black and the ability to catch the eye. The final web colors chosen are #e0e0e0, #101010 and #F00000

3. Fonts  I chose two fonts for my personal project. The first was ubuntu and the second is Old standard TT. Ubuntu is my main font and should be used in all parts of the website. I think the font is eye pleasing when used with my color palette and has a modern feel but an old school charm. Old standard should mainly beused a differentiator and standing out only.

4. Photography  My site is design is simple because of the color scheme and layout. It is meant to be easy to navigate and understand. Any photos on the site should stay in greyscale and black and white when possible. The photos used should be simple in design and project an easy identifable theme. Nothing abstract should be used.

5.  Brand and Voice. The online brand I am trying to project is a simple sophistication. Anything done online should try and maintain the black and white color scheme except when a bold statement is needed.
