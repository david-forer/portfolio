# David Forer
When thinking about what my design would be; I quickly decided on a one picture front with several pages behind it. I didn't want parallax because I wanted each page to stand on its own with a slightly different theme. The cover page will be a picture of me that stands out and is memorable ( i have 2 design options). I will link to social media and probably 2 or 3 pages. About, Resume and 19 things. I also will have a quote that explains a little about my philosphy on life!
