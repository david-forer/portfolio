When trying to decide on what font I wanted to use I needed to decide what kind of personal website I was going to have. I described that as Bold, Edgy and Alternative. With that said I wanted my fonts to epitomize that and also be either futuristic or 70's old school. As for the choices of fonts I want a handwritten font for a quote. The second font will be for typeface of the website. Finally it is possible a third font could be used depending on my final design.
